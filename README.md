# NYC Historical Streets

This repository contains Shapefiles with street centerlines (traced with QGIS), for a selection of Map Warper layers. See https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/qgis-trace-tutorial for details and for information about contributing to these datasets.

__Note: if you're interested in only using the data in this repository (instead of also editing and improving the Shapefiles), it might be easier to use the data published on the website of the [NYC Space/Time Directory](http://spacetime.nypl.org/#data-nyc-streets).__

Note: `layers.json` is a copy of data available in [Building Inspector](http://buildinginspector.nypl.org) and contains metadata for each layer of which Building Inspector has historical address data.
